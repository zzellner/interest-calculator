# interest-calculator
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project takes an initial investment amount and calculates monthly interest over a user determined period.  Results are displayed with and without additional deposits.
What did you do particularly well?
I learned a lot about input verification during this project and implemented safeguards that kept the output from exceeding a reasonable number.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I included too much in my main.  A lot of the user input could have been done through the use of functions.
Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found it difficult to pause the screen so that the user could read both the without additional deposits and with additional deposits information separately.  I ended up taking an input into an unused variable but I'd like to improve my approach next time.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
I received a lot of practice implementing nested loops when calculating monthly interest.  This may transfer into working on 2D arrays.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to incorporate as much as possible into functions.  Functions make the program more maintainable since they divide the program into smaller executable chunks.
